# lightwall simulation

Simulates a large LED wall driven by some stm32 controllers. Why would I need such a thing? You probably don't. Sorry.

## Using

`yarn install` and you should be ready to go. Start up a webserver (it does many, many things that violate local file sandbox rules), and load sim.html.
